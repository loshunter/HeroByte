# HeroByte TODO

> **Note**: Completed work has been archived in [DONE.md](DONE.md) to keep this list focused on active and future work.

## Goal

Ship a table-ready MVP to run live playtests with real players and a DM. Prioritize drawing/selection stability, DM session controls, and player-facing feedback so we can gather real game-night data fast.

## 1. High-Priority Polish

### Player Experience

- [ ] Verify voice indicator + portrait glow survive reconnects and DM toggles.
- [ ] Refresh tips/tooltips for draw, measure, select so new players get guidance.
- [ ] Bug bash dice log readability for long formulas; adjust formatting if needed.

### DM Workflow

- [ ] Add a shortcut/command to select all tokens owned by a player (with safe undo).
- [ ] Improve map background management (upload feedback, loading spinner).

## 2. QA & Release Prep

- [ ] Run full automated suite (`pnpm test`, `pnpm --filter vtt-server test`, Playwright smoke).
- [ ] Manual two-browser checklist: auth, drawing, partial erase, multi-select, load/save, dice, voice. Archive findings in `test-results/`.
- [ ] Document MVP playtest setup (DM prep steps, recommended browsers, troubleshooting cheatsheet).
- [ ] Update README quick-start with playtest instructions and link to the new checklist.

## 3. Deferred Until After MVP

- README visual assets refresh (screenshots, GIF/video demo).
- Public roadmap and issue labeling workflow.
- LAN/Safari networking investigation.
- Security upgrades: player identity verification, DM authentication flow, post-password re-auth.
- Palette/color system (Phase 15), drawing/pointer polish (Phase 16), roll log redesign (Phase 18), DM provisioning & invites (Phase 19), asset library & grouping (Phase 20).
- Engineering guardrail doc refresh (keep current guidance, revisit post-MVP).

## Phase 13: Future Drawing & Interaction Polish

**Priority**: Medium - Additional polish for drawing workflows

_Multi-select orchestration and partial erasing complete! See [DONE.md](DONE.md) for details._

## Engineering Guardrails (Applies to All Phases)

- [ ] For each feature epic, document module boundaries up front to preserve SRP and wider separation of concerns.
- [ ] Ensure new services/hooks/components expose one responsibility; refactor or extract helpers if responsibilities creep.
- [ ] Capture interface contracts before implementation and drive development with failing tests (TDD) where practical.
- [ ] Maintain or expand automated coverage when touching serialization, networking, or shared state orchestration.
- [ ] Keep `docs/planning/phase19-20-briefing.md` synchronized with Phase 19/20 scope/status updates before merging.

## Phase 15: Palette & Color System (Future)

**Priority**: High - unlocks customizable color workflows and palette sharing

### Phase 15.0: Research & Data Modeling

- [ ] Audit current color/palette data structures and storage locations
- [ ] Research swatch exchange formats (ASE, GPL, JSON) and document import/export requirements
- [ ] Identify reputable palette repositories (e.g., Coolors, Lospec) and licensing constraints for bundled sets

- [ ] Rename "Draw" tool per Phase 15 research outcome and update icons/help text
- [ ] Tag drawings with creator metadata on creation for ownership-aware actions
- [ ] Validate that new drawing ownership services obey SRP (separate tracking vs rendering concerns)

### Phase 16.1: Clear & Erase Behavior

- [ ] Update UI copy to "Clear All Yours" in drawing toolbox and confirm scope limits to invoking user
- [ ] Ensure DM menu variant remains a global "Clear Everyone's Drawings" and verify it nukes all ownership buckets
- [ ] Write regression tests covering both clear modes in multi-user sessions
- [ ] Add focused unit tests (written first) for ownership-aware clear handlers

### Phase 16.2: Pointer & Input Handling

- [ ] Reserve middle mouse for panning/scrolling and prevent tool actions while pressed
- [ ] Fix pointer artifacts left when dragging with middle mouse across tools (measure, pointer, draw)
- [ ] Add manual + automated tests for panning while in other tools to ensure zero residual marks

## Phase 17: Layout, Movement & Branding (Future)

**Priority**: Medium - global UX polish and accessibility improvements

### Phase 17.0: Keyboard Movement

- [ ] Attach grid-aware movement (1 square per press) to W/A/S/D and arrow keys for any selected object
- [ ] Handle diagonal combos and key-repeat pacing without conflicting with text inputs
- [ ] Add tests covering keyboard movement across tokens, drawings, and future object types
- [ ] Keep movement logic isolated (input handling, grid math, networking) to maintain SRP

### Phase 17.1: Window Placement & Scroll UX

- [ ] Define default positions for floating panels to avoid overlap/off-screen spawn
- [ ] Implement auto-resize-to-content behavior with scrollbars only when content exceeds bounds
- [ ] Skin scrollbars to match retro theme with 8-bit triangle arrows and verify accessibility contrast

### Phase 18.1: DM Snapshot Pipeline

- [ ] Define full game-state schema (tokens, NPCs, initiative, turn pointer, drawings with transforms, map state)
- [ ] Implement snapshot export/import with version tagging and integrity checks
- [ ] Verify loaded drawings remain selectable/editable (e.g., castle + drawbridge scenario)
- [ ] Write snapshot tests first (round-trip + ownership retention) before implementing handlers

### Phase 18.2: Roll Log Enhancements

- [ ] Redesign log entries to show total plus right-aligned breakdown (e.g., `D20(6)+D4(2)`) in timestamp color/size pairing
- [ ] Add configuration/tests for multi-die expressions and long modifiers to ensure layout stability
- [ ] Update documentation/tooltips to explain new log formatting

## Phase 19: DM-Driven Player Provisioning (Future)

_Planning brief: see `docs/planning/phase19-20-briefing.md` for slide-ready summary and dependencies._

**Priority**: High - empowers DMs to pre-stage players/tokens and streamline onboarding

### Phase 19.0: Research & Data Contracts

- [ ] Audit current player/session models and identify extension points for DM-assigned identities
- [ ] Research invite-link best practices (security, expiry, one-time use) and document requirements
- [ ] Define SRP-aligned modules: identity registry, invite link service, token-binding orchestrator
- [ ] Write failing tests for invite validation and token-identity binding contracts ahead of implementation

### Phase 19.1: DM Identity Workspace

- [ ] Extend DM menu with "Player Provisioning" panel (visible only in DM mode)
- [ ] Allow DM to create/edit identity cards (name, portrait URL, token asset, default square, HP)
- [ ] Persist identity templates and ensure SoC between UI, state, and persistence layers
- [ ] Add tests (written first) for identity CRUD operations and schema validation

### Phase 19.2: Invite Link Flows

- [ ] Generate single-use invite links that associate a player with a prepared identity
- [ ] Support fallback universal link; ensure DM can toggle "identity claim" window safely
- [ ] Handle failure cases (expired link, already claimed, identity missing) with clear UX and tests
- [ ] Implement SRP-compliant handlers: invitation issuance separate from player session activation

### Phase 19.3: Identity Claim & Reassignment

- [ ] When link succeeds, auto-bind player session to identity (token, portrait, stats) and spawn at configured location
- [ ] Provide DM tools to reassign or revoke identities; ensure SoC between identity manager and scene updates
- [ ] Implement toggled "All identities claimable" mode with guard rails to prevent accidental double-claim
- [ ] Deliver TDD coverage for claim/rescind flows and multi-user concurrency scenarios

## Phase 20: Asset Library & Scene Grouping (Future)

- [ ] Create failing tests covering asset metadata serialization/deserialization

### Phase 20.1: Asset Catalog Foundations

- [ ] Implement library UI (maps, tokens, props, status effects) with filtering/search
- [ ] Allow DM to upload/link assets; ensure SoC between upload handling and catalog rendering
- [ ] Persist catalog locally (initially cookies/localStorage) with future-ready hooks for syncing
- [ ] Add TDD-backed tests for asset CRUD and caching fallback paths

### Phase 20.2: Scene Pinning & Grouping

- [ ] Enable pinning objects together (tokens + props) for grouped transforms
- [ ] Implement detachable groups with hierarchy metadata stored alongside scene objects
- [ ] Ensure pinning logic lives in dedicated module to maintain SRP from rendering
- [ ] Cover group creation/removal with integration tests (write first)

### Phase 20.3: Sharing & Sync

- [ ] Allow export/import of asset bundles (JSON manifest) for sharing across sessions
- [ ] Provide DM option to sync selected assets to players on join; honor bandwidth limits
- [ ] Keep synchronization responsibilities separated (asset service vs real-time transport)
- [ ] Add E2E-style tests validating bundle round-trips and sync opt-in/out behaviors

## Phase 14: Transform Tool Polish & Edge Cases (Future)

**Objective**: Handle edge cases, improve UX, add keyboard shortcuts

- [ ] **Keyboard shortcuts**
  - [ ] Delete key: Delete selected object (if not locked)
  - [ ] ESC: Deselect
  - [ ] Ctrl+D: Duplicate selected object
  - [ ] Ctrl+Z: Undo transform
  - [ ] Shift while dragging: Constrain aspect ratio
  - [ ] Ctrl while rotating: Disable snap to 15°

  - [ ] Very small/large scales (min 0.1x, max 10x)
  - [ ] Rotation wrapping (0° to 360°, then back to 0°)
  - [ ] Off-screen objects (show gizmo at viewport edge?)

- [ ] **Visual polish**
  - [ ] Smooth animations (use Konva tweening)
  - [ ] Cursor feedback (resize arrows, rotation icon)
  - [ ] Transform preview (ghosted outline during drag?)
  - [ ] Undo/redo stack visualization

## Phase 15: SOLID Refactor Initiative (Future Work)

**Goal**: Break down remaining oversized "god files", restore SRP/SoC boundaries, and pair each change with forward-looking tests.

**Status**: App.tsx and MainLayout.tsx refactoring COMPLETE (see [DONE.md](DONE.md)). Remaining targets below.

### Remaining Refactoring Targets

- [ ] **DM Controls Modularization** (DMMenu.tsx)
  - [ ] Break `apps/client/src/features/dm/components/DMMenu.tsx` into panels (`MapControls`, `TokenControls`, `RoomManagement`, `DebugPanel`)
  - [ ] Introduce `useDMMenuState` hook to isolate derived state/effects
  - [ ] Cover each panel with interaction tests (e.g., lock toggles, fog controls) and storybook smoke checks

- [ ] **Map Interaction Layers** (MapBoard.tsx)
  - [ ] Decompose `apps/client/src/ui/MapBoard.tsx` into `CameraController`, `SelectionLayer`, and `ToolLayer`
  - [ ] Move pointer/measure/draw orchestration into strategy modules reusable by `TransformGizmo`
  - [ ] Add Vitest suites for camera commands, selection propagation, and tool switching; ensure e2e coverage through transform pipeline tests

- [ ] **Drawing Workflow Cleanup**
  - [ ] Split `apps/client/src/features/map/components/DrawingsLayer.tsx` into rendering vs state adapters
  - [ ] Refactor `apps/client/src/hooks/useDrawingTool.ts` into smaller hooks (`useFreehandTool`, `useShapeTool`, `useUndoRedo`)
  - [ ] Build focused tests per hook (stroke creation, shape handles, undo/redo) and integration tests for drawing persistence

- [ ] **Networking & Messaging Boundaries**
  - [ ] Break `apps/client/src/services/websocket.ts` into connection lifecycle, auth handshake, and message registry modules
  - [ ] Split `apps/server/src/ws/messageRouter.ts` into per-message handler modules with explicit typing
  - [ ] Extract heartbeat/reconnect logic from `apps/server/src/ws/connectionHandler.ts` into dedicated services
  - [ ] Add contract tests that replay canonical message transcripts and verify auth/reconnect flows

- [ ] **Server Domain Isolation**
  - [ ] Separate persistence, validation, and orchestration concerns inside `apps/server/src/domains/room/service.ts`
  - [ ] Break `apps/server/src/middleware/validation.ts` into schema-specific validators (transform, drawing, token, room)
  - [ ] Add regression tests for each validator and update error contract docs
  - [ ] Introduce service-level tests covering room lifecycle (create, join, persist) with in-memory adapters

- [ ] **Shared Models Partitioning**
  - [ ] Split `packages/shared/src/models.ts` into domain slices (`scene`, `player`, `token`, `drawing`)
  - [ ] Maintain backwards compatibility via barrel exports with deprecation notes
  - [ ] Document import guidelines and add lint rule preventing cross-domain leakage
  - [ ] Establish schema snapshot tests to detect accidental API surface regressions

- [ ] **Regression Protection**
  - [ ] Expand coverage for refactored areas (client Vitest, server Jest) to lock behaviour before/after splits
  - [ ] Update architecture diagrams / README to reflect new module boundaries
  - [ ] Add CI guard (lint rule or script) verifying max component size and enforcing boundary checks
  - [ ] Track structural metrics (LOC, dependency graph density) in CI to catch new god-file drift

**Success Criteria** (same as App.tsx refactoring):

- No targeted file exceeds agreed LOC threshold or mixes unrelated responsibilities
- Refactored modules ship with tests authored or updated during refactor (TDD pass)
- Contributor documentation highlights SOLID/SOC guardrails and test requirements for reviews
- CI enforces structural limits and contract tests to prevent regression
