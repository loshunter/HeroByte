## Phase 11: Token Size & Advanced Selection (NEXT)

**Priority**: High
**Effort**: Medium (~3-5 hours)
**Methodology**: Test-Driven Development (write tests first, then implementation)

### Goals
1. Token size variants (tiny/small/medium/large/huge/gargantuan)
2. Selection state management for TransformGizmo
3. Multi-select capabilities
4. Token rotation via gizmo

### Phase 11A: Write Tests First (TDD)

- [ ] **Token Size Tests** (Server-side)
  - [ ] Test: Token model accepts size property (tiny/small/medium/large/huge/gargantuan)
  - [ ] Test: Token model defaults to "medium" size
  - [ ] Test: Validate set-token-size message with valid sizes
  - [ ] Test: Reject set-token-size with invalid size strings
  - [ ] Test: Reject set-token-size with non-string size
  - [ ] Test: TokenService.setTokenSize updates token size
  - [ ] Test: TokenService respects locked state (can't resize locked tokens)
  - [ ] Test: DM can resize locked tokens (override)
  - [ ] Test: Size persists in save/load (RoomService snapshot includes size)
  - [ ] Test: Message router handles set-token-size correctly

- [ ] **Selection State Tests** (Server-side)
  - [ ] Test: Validate select-object message with valid scene object ID
  - [ ] Test: Validate deselect-object message
  - [ ] Test: Reject select-object with missing ID
  - [ ] Test: RoomService tracks selected object per player
  - [ ] Test: Selection state broadcasts to all clients
  - [ ] Test: Selection clears when object is deleted
  - [ ] Test: Selection persists across reconnect (optional)

- [ ] **Multi-Select Tests** (Optional - Server-side)
  - [ ] Test: Validate select-multiple message with array of IDs
  - [ ] Test: Reject select-multiple with non-array
  - [ ] Test: RoomService tracks multiple selections per player
  - [ ] Test: Bulk transform applies to all selected objects

### Phase 11B: Implement Features (After Tests Pass)

- [ ] **Token Size System**
  - [ ] Add `size` property to Token model (default: medium)
  - [ ] Size variants: tiny (0.5x), small (0.75x), medium (1x), large (1.5x), huge (2x), gargantuan (3x)
  - [ ] Add set-token-size message type to @shared
  - [ ] Implement TokenService.setTokenSize with lock check
  - [ ] Add validation middleware for set-token-size
  - [ ] Update RoomService save/load to include size
  - [ ] UI controls in PlayerCard/NpcCard to change size
  - [ ] Visual size scaling on tokens
  - [ ] Respect locked state

- [ ] **Selection State Management**
  - [ ] Add select-object/deselect-object message types to @shared
  - [ ] Add selection tracking to RoomState (Map<uid, selectedObjectId>)
  - [ ] Implement selection broadcast in RoomService
  - [ ] Add selection manager hook (`useObjectSelection`) on client
  - [ ] Single-click to select scene objects
  - [ ] ESC to deselect
  - [ ] Visual selection indicator (highlight border)
  - [ ] Integrate TransformGizmo with selected objects
  - [ ] Selection state synchronized across clients

- [ ] **Multi-Select** (Optional)
