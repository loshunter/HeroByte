### Partial Erasing for Freehand Drawings

**Current Issue**: Eraser deletes entire drawings when touching any part. Users cannot erase just a portion of a detailed sketch.

**Goal**: Allow erasing parts of freehand drawings, splitting them into segments. Lines/shapes still get fully deleted (they're simple enough to redraw).

**Methodology**: Test-Driven Development (write tests first, then implement)

- [ ] **Phase 1: TDD - Write Tests First**
  - [ ] Create `partialErasing.test.ts` test file
  - [ ] Test: `splitFreehandDrawing()` removes middle ‚Üí creates 2 segments
  - [ ] Test: `splitFreehandDrawing()` removes start ‚Üí creates 1 segment
  - [ ] Test: `splitFreehandDrawing()` removes end ‚Üí creates 1 segment
  - [ ] Test: `splitFreehandDrawing()` removes entire drawing ‚Üí returns empty array
  - [ ] Test: Multiple erase passes create correct segments
  - [ ] Test: Filter out segments with < 2 points
  - [ ] Test: Preserve drawing properties (color, width, opacity, owner)
  - [ ] Test: Handle transformed drawings (moved/rotated coordinates)
  - [ ] Test: Edge case - eraser path doesn't intersect (returns original)
  - [ ] Test: Edge case - very close points near eraser boundary
  - [ ] Run tests - all should FAIL (red phase) ‚ùå

- [ ] **Phase 2: TDD - Implement Core Logic**
  - [ ] Create `splitFreehandDrawing(drawing, eraserPath, eraserWidth)` utility function
  - [ ] Implement point-to-eraser distance calculation
  - [ ] Mark points as "keep" or "erase" based on distance < hitRadius
  - [ ] Group consecutive "keep" points into segments
  - [ ] Filter out segments with < 2 points
  - [ ] Handle edge cases: entire drawing erased, only start/end erased, multiple gaps
  - [ ] Run tests - core splitting tests should PASS (green phase) ‚úÖ

- [ ] **Phase 3: TDD - Message Protocol Tests**
  - [ ] Add test: `erase-partial` message validation accepts valid message
  - [ ] Add test: `erase-partial` message validation rejects missing fields
  - [ ] Add test: `erase-partial` message validation rejects invalid segment data
  - [ ] Add test: Message router routes `erase-partial` to correct handler
  - [ ] Run tests - all should FAIL (red phase) ‚ùå

- [ ] **Phase 4: TDD - Implement Message Protocol**
  - [ ] Create new `erase-partial` message type in @shared/index.ts
  - [ ] Message schema: `{ t: "erase-partial", deleteId: string, segments: DrawingData[] }`
  - [ ] Add validation middleware for erase-partial messages
  - [ ] Update messageRouter to handle erase-partial
  - [ ] Run tests - message protocol tests should PASS (green phase) ‚úÖ

- [ ] **Phase 5: TDD - Server-Side Processing Tests**
  - [ ] Add test: Server deletes original drawing atomically
  - [ ] Add test: Server creates all segments atomically
  - [ ] Add test: Transaction fails if deleteId not found
  - [ ] Add test: Broadcast erase-partial to all clients
  - [ ] Add test: Scene graph updated with new segments
  - [ ] Run tests - all should FAIL (red phase) ‚ùå

- [ ] **Phase 6: TDD - Implement Server Processing**
  - [ ] Implement RoomService.handlePartialErase() method
  - [ ] Delete original drawing from state
  - [ ] Create new segment drawings with unique IDs
  - [ ] Update scene graph atomically
  - [ ] Broadcast changes to all clients
  - [ ] Run tests - server processing tests should PASS (green phase) ‚úÖ

- [ ] **Phase 7: TDD - Client Integration Tests**
  - [ ] Add test: useDrawingTool calls splitFreehandDrawing on eraser release
  - [ ] Add test: Client sends erase-partial message with correct data
  - [ ] Add test: Lines/rects/circles still use delete-drawing (no splitting)
  - [ ] Add test: Client doesn't send message if no segments created
  - [ ] Run tests - all should FAIL (red phase) ‚ùå

- [ ] **Phase 8: TDD - Implement Client Integration**
  - [ ] Update useDrawingTool.ts eraser logic to call splitFreehandDrawing
  - [ ] Send erase-partial message instead of delete-drawing for freehand
  - [ ] Preserve full deletion for line/rect/circle shapes
  - [ ] Handle case where splitting produces no segments (full deletion)
  - [ ] Run tests - client integration tests should PASS (green phase) ‚úÖ

- [ ] **Phase 9: TDD - Undo/Redo Tests**
  - [ ] Add test: Undo partial erase restores original, deletes segments
  - [ ] Add test: Redo partial erase deletes original, creates segments
  - [ ] Add test: Batch operation tracked as single undo item
  - [ ] Add test: Multiple undo/redo cycles work correctly
  - [ ] Run tests - all should FAIL (red phase) ‚ùå

- [ ] **Phase 10: TDD - Implement Undo/Redo**
  - [ ] Extend undo stack to support batch operations
  - [ ] Track erase-partial as atomic undo operation
  - [ ] Implement undo: delete segments, restore original
  - [ ] Implement redo: delete original, recreate segments
  - [ ] Run tests - undo/redo tests should PASS (green phase) ‚úÖ

- [ ] **Phase 11: Refactor & Optimize**
  - [ ] Refactor: Extract helper functions for clarity
  - [ ] Optimize: Add bounding box checks before distance calculations
  - [ ] Optimize: Spatial optimization for large drawings (500+ points)
  - [ ] Profile performance with large test drawings
  - [ ] Run all tests - ensure no regressions (green phase maintained) ‚úÖ

- [ ] **Phase 12: Final Validation**
  - [ ] Run full test suite (unit + integration)
  - [ ] Manual testing: Erase middle of sketch in UI
  - [ ] Manual testing: Undo/redo works as expected
  - [ ] Manual testing: Multiple clients see same result
  - [ ] Code review and documentation
  - [ ] Verify all tests passing: `pnpm test` ‚úÖ
  - [ ] Verify coverage maintained >80%
  - [ ] Commit with comprehensive test results in commit message

**Success Criteria**:
- ‚úÖ Users can erase portions of freehand drawings without losing entire sketch
- ‚úÖ Eraser creates clean splits (no visual artifacts)
- ‚úÖ All drawing properties preserved in segments
- ‚úÖ Undo/redo works correctly for partial erasing
- ‚úÖ Performance acceptable for typical drawings (50-500 points)

### Critical Bug Fixes

- [ ] Portrait placeholder UX (`PortraitSection`): show a token-colored call-to-action square when no portrait is set, while keeping the click-to-change affordance.
- [ ] Auth landing state: disable the connect button and animate the ‚ÄúConnecting‚Ä¶‚Äù status while the client establishes a session.

## ‚úÖ Phase 14: Universal Visual Transform System (COMPLETE - Oct 2025)

**Status**: Transform gizmo fully implemented and tested. All automated tests passing (150/150).

**Priority**: CRITICAL - Core functionality restored, UX significantly improved

**Completion Time**: ~15-20 hours across 5 sub-phases

### Current Critical Issues

**Issue 1: Map Transforms Not Applied** üî¥ BLOCKING
- **Problem**: DM Menu UI for map scale/rotate/position exists but doesn't work
- **Root Cause**: `MapImageLayer` component doesn't receive or apply transform from scene objects
- **Impact**: Map cannot be scaled/rotated/repositioned despite UI controls
- **Location**: [MapImageLayer.tsx:20-28](apps/client/src/features/map/components/MapImageLayer.tsx#L20-L28)
- **Expected**: MapImageLayer should read `mapObject.x`, `mapObject.y`, `mapObject.scaleX`, `mapObject.scaleY`, `mapObject.rotation`
- **Actual**: Only applies camera transform, ignores object transform

**Issue 2: No Visual Transform Handles** üî¥ BLOCKING
- **Problem**: All transforms done via numeric inputs or sliders in DM Menu
- **Root Cause**: No visual transform gizmo component (like Photoshop/Figma/Unity)
- **Impact**: Unintuitive UX, requires guessing numbers, no visual feedback
- **User Expectation**: Click object ‚Üí see resize handles ‚Üí drag to scale/rotate

### Vision: Photoshop-Style Transform System

**Goal**: Universal visual transform controls for ALL scene objects (maps, tokens, drawings, shapes)

**Interaction Model**:
```
1. SELECT: Click any object ‚Üí Transform handles appear around it
2. MOVE: Drag center ‚Üí Object moves (already works for tokens)
3. SCALE: Drag edge/corner handle ‚Üí Object scales proportionally
4. ROTATE: Drag corner handle with modifier (Shift?) ‚Üí Object rotates around center
5. LOCK: Lock icon overlay ‚Üí Prevents transforms (already implemented)
```

**Visual Design**:
```
‚îå‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îê
‚îÇ  ‚¨úÔ∏è Map or Token or Drawing  ‚îÇ  ‚Üê Bounding box with 8 handles
‚îÇ         (Selected)           ‚îÇ
‚îÇ                              ‚îÇ
‚îÇ  ‚¨úÔ∏è Handle (4 corners)        ‚îÇ  ‚Üê Corner: Scale + Rotate
‚îÇ  ‚¨úÔ∏è Handle (4 edges)          ‚îÇ  ‚Üê Edge: Scale in one direction
‚îÇ         üîí (if locked)        ‚îÇ  ‚Üê Lock indicator
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îò
```

### Implementation Plan

#### Phase 14.1: Fix Map Transform Rendering ‚úÖ COMPLETE

**Objective**: Make existing DM Menu controls actually work

- [x] **Update MapImageLayer to apply scene object transform**
  - [x] Read transform from `mapObject` prop (x, y, scaleX, scaleY, rotation)
  - [x] Apply transform to Konva Group/Image separate from camera
  - [x] Test: DM Menu scale slider should visually scale map ‚úÖ
  - [x] Test: DM Menu rotation slider should visually rotate map ‚úÖ

  - [x] Check server updates scene object in room state ‚úÖ
  - [x] Check server broadcasts to all clients ‚úÖ
  - [x] Check clients update snapshot and re-render ‚úÖ

**Files Modified**:
- `apps/client/src/features/map/components/MapImageLayer.tsx` - Added nested Group for proper transform order

## Phase 15: SOLID Refactor Initiative (Planned)

**Goal**: Break down oversized "god files", restore SRP/SoC boundaries, and pair each change with forward-looking tests.

- [ ] **Guardrails & Baseline**
  - [ ] Record current line counts and responsibilities for top 10 files (`rg --files` + `wc -l` or dedicated script)
  - [ ] Define max LOC per component (<350) and cross-domain import rules
  - [ ] Update CONTRIBUTING.md with SOLID/SOC checklist and reviewer prompts

- [ ] **TDD & Safety Net**
  - [ ] Capture characterization tests for each hotspot before refactor (App shell, DM menu, Map board, WebSocket service, validation pipeline)
  - [ ] Create snapshot of critical integration pathways (scene transforms, DM controls, connection lifecycle) using shared fixtures
  - [ ] Stand up golden-path contract tests to enforce message shapes across client/server boundaries
  - [ ] Add mutation/coverage gates for new modules to ensure tests drive code (min 80% per module)

- [ ] **Client Shell Decomposition**
  - [ ] Split `apps/client/src/ui/App.tsx` into `AppProviders`, `SessionLifecycle`, and `HudLayout`
  - [ ] Move auth gate UI/state into an `AuthGate` component + `useRoomAuth` hook
  - [ ] Extract dice orchestration into a `DicePanel` feature module
  - [ ] Write feature tests around session join/leave, dice roll propagation, and HUD visibility toggles before/after split

- [ ] **DM Controls Modularization**
  - [ ] Break `apps/client/src/features/dm/components/DMMenu.tsx` into panels (`MapControls`, `TokenControls`, `RoomManagement`, `DebugPanel`)
  - [ ] Introduce `useDMMenuState` hook to isolate derived state/effects
  - [ ] Cover each panel with interaction tests (e.g., lock toggles, fog controls) and storybook smoke checks

- [ ] **Map Interaction Layers**
  - [ ] Decompose `apps/client/src/ui/MapBoard.tsx` into `CameraController`, `SelectionLayer`, and `ToolLayer`
  - [ ] Move pointer/measure/draw orchestration into strategy modules reusable by `TransformGizmo`
  - [ ] Add Vitest suites for camera commands, selection propagation, and tool switching; ensure e2e coverage through transform pipeline tests

- [ ] **Drawing Workflow Cleanup**
  - [ ] Split `apps/client/src/features/map/components/DrawingsLayer.tsx` into rendering vs state adapters
  - [ ] Refactor `apps/client/src/hooks/useDrawingTool.ts` into smaller hooks (`useFreehandTool`, `useShapeTool`, `useUndoRedo`)
  - [ ] Build focused tests per hook (stroke creation, shape handles, undo/redo) and integration tests for drawing persistence

- [ ] **Networking & Messaging Boundaries**
  - [ ] Break `apps/client/src/services/websocket.ts` into connection lifecycle, auth handshake, and message registry modules
  - [ ] Split `apps/server/src/ws/messageRouter.ts` into per-message handler modules with explicit typing
  - [ ] Extract heartbeat/reconnect logic from `apps/server/src/ws/connectionHandler.ts` into dedicated services
  - [ ] Add contract tests that replay canonical message transcripts and verify auth/reconnect flows

- [ ] **Server Domain Isolation**
  - [ ] Separate persistence, validation, and orchestration concerns inside `apps/server/src/domains/room/service.ts`
  - [ ] Break `apps/server/src/middleware/validation.ts` into schema-specific validators (transform, drawing, token, room)
  - [ ] Add regression tests for each validator and update error contract docs
  - [ ] Introduce service-level tests covering room lifecycle (create, join, persist) with in-memory adapters

- [ ] **Shared Models Partitioning**
  - [ ] Split `packages/shared/src/models.ts` into domain slices (`scene`, `player`, `token`, `drawing`)
  - [ ] Maintain backwards compatibility via barrel exports with deprecation notes
  - [ ] Document import guidelines and add lint rule preventing cross-domain leakage
  - [ ] Establish schema snapshot tests to detect accidental API surface regressions

- [ ] **Regression Protection**
  - [ ] Expand coverage for refactored areas (client Vitest, server Jest) to lock behaviour before/after splits
  - [ ] Update architecture diagrams / README to reflect new module boundaries
  - [ ] Add CI guard (lint rule or script) verifying max component size and enforcing boundary checks
  - [ ] Track structural metrics (LOC, dependency graph density) in CI to catch new god-file drift

**Success Criteria**:
- ‚úÖ No targeted file exceeds agreed LOC threshold or mixes unrelated responsibilities
- ‚úÖ Refactored modules ship with tests authored or updated during refactor (TDD pass)
- ‚úÖ Contributor documentation highlights SOLID/SOC guardrails and test requirements for reviews
- ‚úÖ CI enforces structural limits and contract tests to prevent regression

### Technical Architecture

**Transform Data Flow**:
```
1. User drags gizmo handle
   ‚Üì
2. TransformGizmo calculates new transform
   ‚Üì
3. onTransform callback ‚Üí App.tsx
   ‚Üì
4. Optimistic update (local state)
   ‚Üì
5. Send transform-object message to server
   ‚Üì
6. Server validates & broadcasts
   ‚Üì
7. All clients update scene graph
   ‚Üì
8. Re-render with new transform
```

**Key Components**:
- `TransformGizmo.tsx` - Visual handles, drag logic
- `MapBoard.tsx` - Selection state, render gizmo
- `MapImageLayer.tsx` - Apply map transform
- `TokensLayer.tsx` - Apply token transform (already works)
- `DrawingsLayer.tsx` - Apply drawing transform (needs update)

**Message Protocol** (already exists):
```typescript
{
  t: "transform-object",
  id: string,            // Scene object ID
  x?: number,            // Position
  y?: number,
  scaleX?: number,       // Scale
  scaleY?: number,
  rotation?: number      // Rotation in degrees
}
```

### Success Criteria (Overall)

**Must Have** (Phase 14.1-14.3):
- ‚úÖ Map transforms work (DM Menu controls apply visually)
- ‚úÖ Visual transform gizmo for maps
- ‚úÖ Visual transform gizmo for tokens
- ‚úÖ Visual transform gizmo for drawings
- ‚úÖ All transforms sync across clients
- ‚úÖ Lock state respected

**Nice to Have** (Phase 14.4-14.5):
- ‚úÖ Keyboard shortcuts (Delete, ESC, Shift, Ctrl)
- ‚úÖ Visual polish (smooth animations, cursors)
- ‚úÖ Edge case handling (off-screen, very small/large)
- ‚úÖ Documentation and demo video

**Future Enhancements** (Phase 15+):
- [ ] Multi-select transforms (transform multiple objects at once)
- [ ] Transform presets (reset, fit to grid, center)
- [ ] Transform history (undo/redo stack UI)
- [ ] Touch/mobile transform gestures (pinch to scale, rotate)

### Benefits

- üéØ **Fix Critical Bug**: Map transforms finally work
- üéØ **Intuitive UX**: Visual handles like Photoshop/Figma
- üéØ **Universal System**: Same controls for all objects
- üéØ **Professional Feel**: Modern VTT standard feature
- üéØ **DM Productivity**: Fast, visual map/token positioning
- üéØ **Player Empowerment**: Players can resize their own tokens

**Implementation Priority Order**:
1. **Pointer Tool** (HIGH, most complex) - Affects DM communication
2. **Portrait Placeholder** (HIGH, quick win) - Affects all players immediately
3. **Landing Page Connection** (MEDIUM, quick win) - First impression fix
4. **Measure Tool** (MEDIUM, moderate) - Nice enhancement for DMs

**Benefits**:
- üéØ Fixes broken pointer tool behavior (critical DM feature)
- üéØ Improves new player onboarding (portrait discovery)
- üéØ Professional connection handling (no more "is it hung?" moments)
- üéØ D&D-standard measurement display (squares + feet)
