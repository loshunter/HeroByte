Load sceneObjects from snapshot\n2. Load drawings from snapshot\n3. Call rebuildSceneGraph which converts drawings to MORE scene objects\n4. Result: duplicate drawing objects with same IDs\n\n## Solution\nOnly load legacy drawings array if snapshot doesn''t have sceneObjects.\nThis ensures we don''t double-convert the same data.\n\nðŸ¤– Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)\n\nCo-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>\nEOF\n)\")",

Manual QA showed the feature\nworked perfectly - visual behavior was correct, undo/redo functioned as\nexpected, and multi-client sync was working.\n\n## Root Cause\nThe issue was test environment state pollution, NOT a bug in the code:\n- Server persists state in `apps/server/herobyte-state.json`\n- This file accumulated drawings from previous test runs\n- Tests shared the same room and inherited polluted state\n- E2E tests expected clean initial state but got accumulated state\n- Tests timed out because they were looking for specific drawing IDs\n  that were mixed in with leftovers from previous runs\n\n## Solution\n1. Created `apps/e2e/global-setup.ts` to clear state file before all tests\n2. Added `beforeEach` hook to clear drawings before each test\n3. Disabled parallel test execution (`fullyParallel: false`) to avoid\n   room state conflicts between concurrent tests\n4. Fixed test assertions to work with clean state\n\n## Test Results\nâœ… ALL 4 E2E TESTS PASS (11.0s total)\n- âœ… Single Client - Partial Erase with Undo/Redo\n- âœ… Multi-Client - Partial Erase Synchronization  \n- âœ… player can partially erase a freehand drawing and create segments\n- âœ… partial erase supports undo and redo\n\n## Server Code Verification\nThe server logic in `apps/server/src/domains/map/service.ts:handlePartialErase`\nworks correctly:\n- âœ… Removes original drawing from state.drawings\n- âœ… Creates new segment drawings with unique IDs\n- âœ… Records operation in undo stack correctly\n- âœ… Broadcasts updated state to all clients\n- âœ… Undo properly restores original and removes segments\n- âœ… Redo properly removes original and restores segments\n\n**No bugs found - partial erase feature is ready for MVP launch.**\n\nðŸ¤– Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)\n\nCo-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>\nEOF\n)\")",
