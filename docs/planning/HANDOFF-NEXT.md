# Handoff — after S8, with the Session One arc complete

Read this whole file before touching anything. Every path and number below was opened and
verified on 2026-08-05 at `dev` = `951a3d2a`. Where something is a judgement call rather than a
fact, it says so.

## 0. Where things stand

**The Session One arc is DONE.** `docs/planning/session-one-arc.md` is the source of truth.
S0–S7 are in production; **S8 is on `dev` and NOT deployed.**

| Branch | Commit    | State                                                          |
| ------ | --------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `dev`  | `951a3d2a` | 5 S8 commits on top of `main`. CI not yet run on these.        |
| `main` | `5307d0dd` | production, deployed, green                                    |

S8's five commits:

```
951a3d2a docs: S8 shipped, and the Session One arc is complete
201cda89 fix(dm): a whitespace-only NPC name became no name at all
3f22ad08 fix(shared): the barrel cannot declare a runtime const, so stop it doing so
254539d3 feat(dm): five goblins in one press, and duplicate for the sixth
5af9d68c feat(help): a manual you can reach without leaving the table
```

**What S8 shipped.** A `? Help` button in the header opening an eight-topic in-app manual (and a
Help entry in the mobile tool sheet opening the same one), plus a `×N` field beside **+ Add NPC**
and a `⧉ Duplicate` on every NPC card. `create-npc` gained an optional `count`; the server loops
and numbers.

**⚠️ S8 has never been adversarially reviewed.** All six lenses errored on the account's *weekly*
usage limit before doing any work, and the workflow returned `{rawCount: 0, survived: []}` — the
identical shape a genuinely clean review returns. `agents_done: 0`, `agents_error: 6`, and
`journal.jsonl` had zero `result` lines. It is the only slice of the nine with no independent
review. A self-review by empirically probing the name allocator's edges found one real regression
(`" "` became `""`) which is fixed in `201cda89`, but that is not a substitute. **If you do one
thing from this document, make it re-running that review** — the limit resets 2026-08-08 19:00
America/Vancouver.

The working tree is clean apart from untracked files under `temp/`. Those are the owner's local
art assets. **Never `git add temp/` and never `git add <directory>`** — a broad add swept them
into main once before, and untracking them then deleted them off disk. Stage files explicitly by
path, always.

**Commit policy, unchanged and confirmed:** commit to `dev` as you go. **Do not push, and do not
merge to `main`, unless the owner asks.** `main` IS production and auto-deploys the moment it
moves — Render watches `main` from its own dashboard, so the deploy is NOT gated by CI
(`DEPLOYMENT.md:24-26`).

## 1. Running it

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev          # client http://localhost:5174, server http://localhost:8787
```

Table password `Fun1`, DM password `FunDM`. Default table is the public "Main Hall". DM elevation
from a console (dev/test builds only):

```js
window.__HERO_BYTE_E2E__.sendMessage({ t: "elevate-to-dm", dmPassword: "FunDM" });
```

`pnpm dev` sets `HEROBYTE_DEV_ALLOW_LAN=true`, so a phone on the same Wi-Fi can reach the Network
URL Vite prints. Never use Bash to run dev servers — use the Browser pane's `preview_start`;
`.claude/launch.json` really does define `server` and `client` (it is at the REPO ROOT, so a
`cat .claude/launch.json` from inside a package will tell you it does not exist).

## 2. The verification gate — all of it, before every commit

```bash
CI=true pnpm build            # MUST precede typecheck and test
CI=true pnpm typecheck && CI=true pnpm lint && CI=true pnpm lint:structure:enforce && CI=true pnpm format:check
CI=true pnpm test
CI=true pnpm --filter herobyte-client build:check
CI=true pnpm test:e2e --reporter=list
```

`CI=true` matters — pnpm aborts on no TTY here. Build first is not optional: the server resolves
`@herobyte/shared` from `dist/` while the client resolves it from `src/`.
`pnpm lint:structure:enforce` is **NOT** part of `pnpm lint`.

**And one thing the gate cannot see — boot the dev server.** See §7.

### Baselines at `951a3d2a`

| suite         | count                                    |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| shared        | 411 tests / 23 files                     |
| server        | 2042 tests / 109 files                   |
| client        | all 43 batches green                     |
| client bundle | 96.75 KB gzip vs a 175 KB threshold      |
| e2e           | **97 passed / 0 failed / 3 skipped**     |

E2E was 83 before S8's 14 new specs (4 desktop help, 5 mobile help, 5 bulk-NPC). Get the true
tally with `--reporter=list` and read the summary line — the human-readable reporter miscounts.

Single file, not the whole suite. **The path is relative to the PACKAGE, not the repo** — `pnpm
--filter` sets cwd to the package, and getting this wrong makes every run look broken for the
wrong reason:

```bash
CI=true pnpm --filter herobyte-client exec vitest run src/path/to/file.test.tsx
CI=true pnpm --filter vtt-server exec vitest run src/path/to/file.test.ts
CI=true pnpm test:e2e --project=mobile-chromium --grep "some name"
```

## 3. What to do next — the field is open

The arc is complete, so there is no queued slice. In rough order of how strongly the code argues
for them:

### A. Re-run S8's adversarial review (do this first, ~half a day)

Fan out read-only reviewers by lens over `git diff 391676a1..951a3d2a` — correctness, regression,
security, test quality, mobile/a11y, and factual accuracy of the manual — then a separate pass
that tries to REFUTE each finding. A ready-made script is at
`~/.claude/projects/D--HeroByte/.../workflows/scripts/s8-adversarial-review-wf_b25ece50-2c3.js`;
it is correct, it simply never got to run. **Check `agents_error` before believing the verdict.**

Highest-value lenses given what S8 touched: **correctness** on `npcNaming.ts` (the allocator is
the only real logic in the slice), and **ux-copy** on `helpTopics.ts`, which makes roughly sixty
factual claims about how HeroByte works — a manual that lies is worse than no manual, and only a
sample of those claims was checked by hand.

### B. A room-level default vision radius (~2 days) — the strongest feature candidate

S7 left this open deliberately and it is still the best next slice. A player who deletes their
ONLY token and reconnects respawns with **unlimited sight**: a radius lives on one token record
while vision is the UNION over all of an owner's tokens, and `createToken` inherits the owner's
tightest limit, which closes the ordinary "+ Add Character" path but not this one, because there
is nothing left to inherit from. Documented in `domains/token/service.ts` and the arc doc.

Closing it needs a room-level default: a new **required** `RoomState` field, persistence, a
snapshot field, and four server fixtures that build state literals (see §7). It is also probably
the feature a DM wants anyway — "this dungeon is dark" as a table setting rather than per token.

### C. The mobile authoring arc (`docs/planning/mobile-authoring-arc.md`, M3–M8)

A launch commitment, and the arc doc says it runs AFTER Session One — which is now. Two known
mobile gaps feed straight into it:

- **The mobile party drawer renders one row per PLAYER** and resolves it to that player's FIRST
  character, so a DM on a phone cannot reach a second character's token at all — HP, portrait and
  sight radius alike. Fixing it means making that list per-character.
- **There is no mobile DM menu at all.** Mobile renders `MobileLayout`, which never reaches
  `FloatingPanelsLayout`, which is the only thing that renders `DMMenu`. That is why S8's bulk-add
  is desktop-only. It was explicitly out of Session One's scope (§6), not an oversight.

### D. Smaller, real, and unclaimed

- **`+ ADD PORTRAIT` and the NpcCard portrait still use `window.prompt("Enter image URL")`** —
  URL-only secondary paths to fields that already have upload. S8 touched the NPC surface and did
  NOT fold this in. Ask the owner before doing it.
- **Chat's SEND button is a 25px tap target** (guideline 44px). It matches every other JRPGButton
  in those panels, so it wants a deliberate panel-wide pass, not a one-button fix.
- **Client-side `Math.random()` initiative rolls** remain in `hooks/useBulkInitiativeRoll.ts` and
  `features/initiative/components/InitiativeModal.tsx`. Not a forgery hole (both are DM-only paths
  where the DM can set the value directly), but they are the last client-owned randomness.
  `InitiativeModal.test.tsx:692` explicitly pins `Math.random()` as behaviour.
- **The dice parser accepts juxtaposition** (`"d20d6"` → two dice, no operator). Unreachable
  today — there is no free-text formula input anywhere in the UI. It becomes real the moment
  someone adds one.
- **`drag-preview` is queued rather than dropped while the socket is down**, so a reconnect can
  replay stale previews. S6 fixed this for `measure` via an `ephemeralTypes` set in
  `MessageQueueManager` and deliberately did NOT change `drag-preview`; the same fix applies.
- **The asset-store dedup path double-counts existing bytes** against the whole-store quota on a
  cross-room claim. Pre-existing and conservative in direction (refuses too early).
- **A background-task chip is already queued** for wiring `characterDrawings.ts` to the shared
  `DRAWING_TYPES` instead of its hand-copied `VALID_DRAWING_TYPES` (see §7).

## 4. What S8 actually built, if you have to touch it

**The help panel.** `features/help/helpTopics.ts` (content as DATA), `HelpPanel.tsx` (renderer,
shared by both surfaces), `HelpMenuButton.tsx` (desktop, self-contained — no props, so it never
touches `MainLayoutProps` or its four layout fixtures). The mobile entry lives in
`MobileFloatingControls.tsx` and owns its own `helpOpen` state, because `MobileLayout.tsx` is at
**347 of a 348 ceiling** and lifting it would have cost an extraction for no gain.

Content decision, owner-made 2026-08-05: **curated in-app prose + links out to the guides on
GitHub**, not the guide markdown itself. `docs/user-guide/` is outside `apps/client` (what Pages
builds), its `img/` is **4.8 MB across 36 screenshots**, and the client has no markdown renderer —
so "bundle the guides" meant a new runtime dependency or a hand-written renderer for one panel.
Cost as built: 92.83 → 96.75 KB gzip. **If a slice changes behaviour the manual describes, update
`helpTopics.ts` in the same slice** — it is not generated from the guides and will drift.

**Bulk NPC add.** The chain, all verified: `packages/shared/src/index.ts` (the `count` field) →
`packages/shared/src/npcLimits.ts` (`NPC_CREATE_LIMITS`, max 20) →
`middleware/validators/characterValidators.ts` (bounded; its test is in
`middleware/__tests__/validation.test.ts`, NOT a router test) → `ws/dispatchers/CharacterDispatcher.ts`
→ `ws/handlers/NPCMessageHandler.ts` (the loop + the 500-character ceiling) →
`domains/character/npcNaming.ts` (the naming rule).

**Why `count` rides on ONE message** — this is the part not to undo. `useNpcCreation` refuses to
start a second create while one is in flight and only `console.warn`s about it, and it detects
success by watching the character COUNT against a ref. So N client messages are silently dropped
by the app's own guard, and it presents as a flaky server rather than a client bug.

**Duplicate needs no message of its own**: the server already renumbers a colliding name, so a
copy is a `create-npc` whose base name is the original's.

## 5. Traps that will cost you hours

**The 350-LOC guard** flags `content.split("\n").length >= 350`, i.e. `wc -l >= 349`, so **348 is
the real ceiling**. `__tests__` files are exempt; source files are not. It fails only on NEW
violators. `prettier --write` EXPANDS files — re-check LOC after formatting. Live headroom on
files S8 left near the line: `MobileLayout.tsx` **347** (one line!), `characterValidators.ts` 343,
`useDMContext.ts` 343, `NPCEditor.tsx` 333, `helpTopics.ts` 301, `Header.tsx` 262,
`NPCsTab.tsx` 230, `MobileFloatingControls.tsx` 209. Already over and baselined (extract, don't
grow): `layouts/props/MainLayoutProps.ts` 432, `domains/character/service.ts` 376.

**A new `ClientMessage` type is a compile error until you register a validator** in
`messageValidators` (`middleware/validation.ts`) — that table is exhaustive-by-construction. At
runtime an unregistered type returns "Unknown message type". Widening an EXISTING message (what
S8 did with `count`) avoids this entirely.

**`router.route()` runs AFTER validation.** A contract test that routes a malformed frame proves
nothing about the validator, because `MessagePipelineManager` validated it first in production.
Validator coverage belongs in `middleware/__tests__/validation.test.ts`. This gap has now cost
three separate slices a debugging detour.

**`AuthorizationService.requiresDMPrivileges` is dead code.** `isAuthorized` has no runtime
caller. Adding a message type to that Set gates nothing, and its own test asserts hard-coded name
lists, so you would create a GREEN test for a gate that does not exist. The real gates are
`executeIfDMAuthorized` in the dispatcher (what `create-npc` uses), an inline `if (!isDM) throw`
in a handler, or an ownership check in the domain service.

**A new REQUIRED `RoomState` field breaks four server fixtures** that build state literals
(`ws/__tests__/messageRouter.test.ts`, `.../characterization/authorization.characterization.test.ts`,
`.../error-handling.characterization.test.ts`, `ws/services/__tests__/AuthorizationService.test.ts`,
plus `sessionRoundTrip.contract.test.ts`). An OPTIONAL field on a wire message breaks none of them.
Typecheck catches it either way. **This is the main cost of option B above.**

**New `MainLayoutProps` fields must be OPTIONAL** or the layout fixtures break — grep
`"optional so the layout fixtures stay untouched"`. The self-contained header pattern
(`JuiceMenuButton`, now `HelpMenuButton`) avoids all of this.

**`getByRole` matches the ACCESSIBLE NAME, not `title`.** A locator built on a `title` string
finds nothing and times out looking like an app bug. And `new RegExp(someTitle)` breaks on a title
containing `(DM)` — the parens become a capture group. Prefer the exact accessible-name string.

**A scrolling panel's controls are legitimately off-screen.** "Every control on screen at once" is
the *drawing toolbar's* invariant because it cannot scroll; for a scrolling sheet assert
reachable-by-scrolling instead, and assert separately that the CLOSE control never scrolls away.

**E2E specs that create NPCs must delete them.** The default table is shared between specs AND
between runs, and characters cap at 500. `apps/e2e/npc-bulk-add.spec.ts` shows the pattern:
snapshot the ids before, `try/finally` a cleanup that deletes only what appeared.

**The e2e map canvas is SHORT** — the entities panel takes the bottom half — so a few grid cells
at a zoomed-in camera walks a click clean off it onto the panel. Anchor by canvas FRACTION unless
the test needs an exact world delta.

**Windows.** No `kill -9` — use `Stop-Process -Force` or `kill-windows-port.bat`. Bash heredocs
break on embedded apostrophes and backticks; write the payload with the Write tool and run it with
`python`. **The Bash tool's cwd PERSISTS between calls** — a `cd apps/client` in one call silently
changes where the next `ls`, `cat` or `grep` runs, which will make a file that exists look missing.

**If you write a Python sabotage harness:** pass `CI` through `env=`, never as a `CI=true` prefix
(subprocess with `shell=True` is cmd.exe here, where that prefix is a syntax error and every
command fails for the wrong reason). Force `encoding="utf-8", errors="replace"` or Windows cp1252
crashes the harness on vitest's output. Strip ANSI before regexing. Use package-relative test
paths. Distinguish "N tests failed" from "non-zero exit with no test failure" — a compile error is
not a red test. Working harnesses from S8 are in this session's scratchpad (`sabotage_a.py`,
`sabotage_b.py`) and are worth copying rather than rewriting.

## 6. Layout traps S8 paid for, which will recur

**A fixed container with a `z-index` is a STACKING CONTEXT.** The header is `position: fixed;
z-index: 100`, so a popover rendered inside it cannot paint above the entities panel — a later
sibling at the same z-index — no matter what z-index the popover itself claims. The 500px help
panel lost its bottom half to a panel drawn over it, and every unit test was green because jsdom
computes no layout. **Portal any tall popover to `document.body`.** `JuiceMenuButton` never
noticed because it is a few rows tall; it is still in-place and still fine.

**A vh height and a dock offset do not know about each other.** The mobile help sheet's height
came from a vh fraction while its position came from `bottom: calc(safe + dock + 22px)`. At
812×375 the shared 82vh landscape cap (307px) plus a 102px offset made a 409px sheet in a 375px
viewport, putting its header — and the ✕ that is the only way to close it — 34px above the top of
the screen. **Derive the height FROM the same offset** so "it fits" is arithmetic, and exclude the
sheet from the shared landscape `max-height` override or that will put it back. A long sheet also
needs `position: sticky` on its header, or the close button scrolls away.

Both bugs were invisible to jsdom and to reading the code. `apps/e2e/mobile/mobile-help.spec.ts`
and `apps/e2e/help-panel.spec.ts` now guard them; the desktop one hit-tests
`document.elementFromPoint` inside the panel, which is the assertion that actually catches
occlusion.

## 7. The trap that no test can see — read this before adding a shared constant

**`packages/shared/src/index.ts` must never declare a runtime `const`.**

A direct `export const` in the barrel compiles to `export declare const` in `dist/index.d.ts`,
which is what `apps/server/tsconfig.json` maps `@herobyte/shared` to and what tsx honors **at
runtime** — where an ambient type declaration has no value to import. A value RE-EXPORT from a
real sub-module (`export { X } from "./x.js"`) is followed through to the compiled `.js`.

Adding `NPC_CREATE_LIMITS` to the barrel meant **`pnpm dev` could not boot at all**
(`SyntaxError: does not provide an export named 'NPC_CREATE_LIMITS'`) while `pnpm build`,
`pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm lint`, all three unit suites AND the full 97-test e2e suite were green.
Each of those resolves the package by a route that skips the mapping. Nothing in §2 can see it.

`packages/shared/src/__tests__/barrelValueExports.test.ts` now fails on any top-level
`export const|let|var|function|class` in the barrel and quotes the offending line. **Types are
fine; only runtime values break.** Put the constant in its own module and re-export it —
`npcLimits.ts`, `drawingTypes.ts`, `wsCloseCodes.ts`. **After adding any shared constant, boot the
dev server once.**

Noticed while fixing this and deliberately NOT folded in (a chip is queued for it):
`DRAWING_TYPES` has no importers at all, while `apps/client/src/utils/characterDrawings.ts`
hand-maintains its own `VALID_DRAWING_TYPES` copy of the same six strings — and
`playerPersistence.test.ts:84` already warns in a comment that a missing entry there silently
turns a cone into something else.

## 8. Method the owner expects (these are not optional)

- **Verify before asserting.** An absence is not evidence; exit 0 is not a pass; read the file. If
  you say something is fixed, show the output that proves it. §7 is the strongest example this
  repo has produced: five green suites and a completely broken dev server.
- **Prove every test can fail.** Break the fix, watch it go red, revert. S8 ran 42 sabotages; one
  came back GREEN and it was a genuine finding about unreachable code. When a sabotage stays green,
  suspect the test first — but check the sabotage too, and watch for one that goes red for the
  wrong reason.
- **Probe edges empirically rather than re-reading.** Running S8's name allocator against
  whitespace, padded numbers and unicode found a regression that reading it twice had not.
- **Adversarial review before declaring done — and check `agents_error`.** A review that never ran
  returns the same shape as a clean one. S7's died partway and looked complete; S8's died entirely
  and returned `{rawCount: 0}`. Review agents are read-only; audit `git status` after any errored
  run, because a past run left a mutation probe in the tree.
- **Fix bugs you find regardless of origin**, each in its own commit where the files allow it.
  When a fix is genuinely inseparable, say so loudly in the commit body rather than burying it.
- **Ship the mobile surface in the same slice** (arc §7a — an owner decision). Measure it in the
  browser, do not compute it. If a feature genuinely has no mobile surface, say WHY in the commit
  rather than leaving it unmentioned.
- **Do not poll a Workflow or a background agent.** They notify on completion.

## 9. Owner decisions — settled, do not re-litigate

- The Main Hall is a **public test table on purpose**, including public DM elevation, and the
  published `Fun1` / `FunDM` fallbacks stay in production. Do not re-flag it as a finding.
- Launch is a **friends-scale soft launch**. Signed session tokens are deferred to a later identity
  arc, so `uid` is client-asserted: secrecy is from the other people at the table, not from someone
  willing to impersonate one. Documented at
  `domains/room/snapshot/recipientFilter.ts:63-75`. Not a vulnerability.
- Drawings and area templates are **not position-filtered**, by design.
- **Explored fog is client-local and explicitly NOT a privacy boundary** — it can only re-show map
  ART the client already holds. "localStorage can be edited" is not a finding.
- A radius on an **NPC** token is inert, and the control was deliberately removed from NPC cards.
- Fog deliberately does not hide anything outside the published map rect — staging zones live there.
- Every slice ships its mobile surface in the same slice (arc §7a).
- **The mobile dock stays at five buttons.** `theme/herobyte.css` pins it to
  `repeat(5, minmax(0, 1fr))` and a sixth child overlaps rather than wraps. That is why chat became
  a tab in the roll log, why the dice options went inside the roller, and why S8's Help went in the
  tool sheet. `MobileFloatingControls.test.tsx` now pins it.

## 10. Suggested order of work

1. `git log --oneline -6 && git status --porcelain | grep -v '^?? temp/'` — confirm you are at
   `951a3d2a` with a clean tree.
2. Run the full gate once (§2) to establish that the baselines in this document still hold, and
   **boot `pnpm dev`** (§7).
3. Re-run S8's adversarial review (§3A). Check `agents_error` before believing it. Fix what
   survives refutation, each in its own commit.
4. Ask the owner which of §3B / §3C / §3D they want next — the arc is complete, so this is a
   genuine fork, not a queue.
5. Stop before merging to `main`. That is the owner's call, and it deploys.
