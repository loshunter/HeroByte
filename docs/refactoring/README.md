# HeroByte Refactoring Documentation

**Phase 15: SOLID Refactor Initiative**

This directory contains comprehensive documentation for refactoring the HeroByte codebase to adhere to SOLID principles and eliminate "god files."

---

## Quick Start

### For Engineers Starting a Refactor

1. **Read the Roadmap** → [REFACTOR_ROADMAP.md](./REFACTOR_ROADMAP.md)
   - Find your target module in the extraction order
   - Review dependencies and complexity
   - Check estimated effort

2. **Follow the Playbook** → [REFACTOR_PLAYBOOK.md](./REFACTOR_PLAYBOOK.md)
   - Use the step-by-step checklist
   - Write characterization tests FIRST
   - Extract incrementally
   - Verify at each step

3. **Check Current State** → Run `pnpm lint:structure`
   - See which files need refactoring
   - Get specific hints for god files
   - Track progress

### For Code Reviewers

1. **Verify Playbook Compliance**
   - Check that characterization tests exist
   - Ensure tests are GREEN before and after
   - Verify documentation is complete

2. **Assess Code Quality**
   - Module has single responsibility (SRP)
   - Interface is clean (ISP)
   - Dependencies are explicit (DIP)
   - No behavior changes

3. **Check Metrics**
   - Source file LOC reduced as expected
   - New module under 350 LOC
   - Test coverage maintained or improved

## Project Overview

### The Problem

Three "god files" contain 4,479 lines of code (77% over target):

1. **App.tsx** - 1,850 LOC (5.3x over 350 LOC limit)
   - 27 responsibility clusters
   - Manages everything from auth to rendering

2. **DMMenu.tsx** - 1,588 LOC (4.5x over limit)
   - 20 responsibility clusters
   - DM control panel with all features

3. **MapBoard.tsx** - 1,041 LOC (3x over limit)
   - 32 responsibility clusters
   - Map rendering and interaction orchestration

### The Solution

**Systematic decomposition** into focused modules:

- ✅ Extract 79 distinct responsibility clusters
- ✅ Reduce total LOC from 4,479 → 1,050 (77% reduction)
- ✅ Enforce 350 LOC limit via CI guardrails
- ✅ Maintain or improve test coverage
- ✅ Preserve all existing behavior

### The Benefits

**For Development:**
- Easier to understand and modify
- Faster to locate bugs
- Simpler to add features
- Better test coverage
- Improved code reviews

**For Maintenance:**
- Clear module boundaries
- Reduced cognitive load
- Better documentation
- Easier onboarding
- Less technical debt

**For Architecture:**
- SOLID principles enforced
- Clean dependency graphs
- Reusable components
- Testable in isolation
- Feature-based organization

## Key Concepts

### SOLID Principles

**S - Single Responsibility Principle**
- Each module has ONE clearly defined purpose
- Files under 350 LOC (enforced by CI)
- Components render UI OR orchestrate logic, not both

**O - Open/Closed Principle**
- Use composition over configuration
- Extract extensible hooks and component patterns
- Enable feature additions without modifying existing code

**L - Liskov Substitution Principle**
- Maintain consistent prop interfaces
- Extracted components are drop-in replacements
- Preserve existing behavior during refactoring

**I - Interface Segregation Principle**
- Props interfaces tailored to component needs
- No "god objects" passed through component trees
- Explicit dependencies over implicit coupling

**D - Dependency Inversion Principle**
- Extract hooks with dependency injection
- Components depend on abstractions (hooks/contexts)
- Business logic decoupled from UI rendering

### Refactoring Safety

**Test-Driven Decomposition (TDD)**
1. Write characterization tests BEFORE extraction
2. Extract module with tests passing
3. Verify tests still pass after extraction
4. Add comprehensive unit tests for new module
5. Maintain or improve coverage

**Incremental Refactoring**
- Extract one cluster at a time
- Commit and test after each extraction
- Keep main branch deployable
- Small, reviewable PRs (<300 LOC changes)

**Dependency Management**
- Extract low-dependency modules first (quick wins)
- Build module library incrementally
- Tackle complex orchestration last
- Avoid circular dependencies

## FAQ

### Q: Can I extract modules in a different order than the roadmap?

**A:** Generally, follow the roadmap order to respect dependencies. However, if you have a good reason (expertise, urgency, etc.), you can deviate. Just ensure all dependencies are extracted first.

### Q: What if I find bugs during extraction?

**A:** Document the bug but **do not fix it during extraction**. Extract first, then fix the bug in a separate PR. This keeps refactoring focused and reviewable.

### Q: Can I improve the code while extracting?

**A:** Extract first (behavior preservation), refactor second (two separate commits). This makes review easier and reduces regression risk.

### Q: What if tests are missing for the code I'm extracting?

**A:** Write characterization tests BEFORE extraction. This is non-negotiable for safe refactoring.

### Q: How do I handle circular dependencies?

**A:**
1. Hoist shared types to separate file
2. Use dependency injection
3. Reorder extractions
4. Extract shared dependencies first

### Q: What if the extracted module exceeds 350 LOC?

**A:** Break it down further! If a single responsibility requires >350 LOC, it's likely multiple responsibilities. Re-analyze and split.

### Q: Can I add features while refactoring?

**A:** No. Refactoring should be behavior-preserving. Add features in separate PRs after refactoring is complete.

### Q: How do I know if my extraction is good?

**A:** Check:
- ✅ Module has single, clear responsibility
- ✅ Under 350 LOC
- ✅ All tests passing
- ✅ No behavior changes
- ✅ Clean, documented interface
- ✅ PR approved by reviewers
