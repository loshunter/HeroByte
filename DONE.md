## ✅ Phase 9: Scene Graph & Transform Overhaul (COMPLETE - Oct 2025)

  - [ ] DM controls for map scale/rotation/lock in DM menu - DEFERRED to Phase 10

- [ ] **Drawing Refactor** - DEFERRED to Phase 10
  - [ ] Convert stored drawings to individual `SceneObject`s with metadata
  - [ ] Enable move/scale/rotate on drawings; update undo/redo to operate on IDs

- [ ] **Token Enhancements** - DEFERRED to Phase 10
  - [ ] Token objects support rotation/scale when unlocked
  - [ ] Persist per-token lock state; expose toggle in settings
  - [ ] Prepare initiative metadata field for future combat tracker

**Status**: Core architecture complete. Transform messages working. UI controls deferred to Phase 10.

## ✅ Phase 10: Transform UI & Lock Controls (COMPLETE - Oct 2025)

**Status**: All features implemented and tested. 116/116 tests passing.

- [x] **Transform Gizmo Component**
  - [x] Create `TransformGizmo.tsx` with Konva Transformer
  - [x] Visual handles for rotate and scale (translate via drag already works)
  - [x] Attach to selected scene objects
  - [x] Respect `locked` flag (disable handles when locked)

- [x] **Lock Controls UI**
  - [x] Add lock toggle to PlayerCard/NpcCard token settings
  - [x] Add lock button in DM menu for map object
  - [x] Visual indicator for locked objects (lock icon overlay with `LockIndicator.tsx`)
  - [x] Sync lock state via transform-object message

- [x] **DM Map Transform Controls**
  - [x] DM menu section for map positioning
  - [x] Position (x, y) input fields
  - [x] Scale slider (0.1x - 3x)
  - [x] Rotation slider (0° - 360°)
  - [x] Lock map button
  - [x] Reset transform button

- [ ] **Selection & Multi-Select** (Optional)
  - [ ] Selection manager for scene objects - DEFERRED to Phase 11
  - [ ] Click to select, ctrl+click for multi-select
  - [ ] Drag rectangle selection
  - [ ] Group transforms for multiple objects

## ✅ Phase 11: Token Size System (COMPLETE - Oct 2025)

**Status**: Token size system fully implemented with TDD methodology. 146/146 tests passing, 80.99% coverage.

### Completed Features

- [x] **Token Size System**
  - [x] Add `size` property to Token model (default: medium)
  - [x] Size variants: tiny (0.5x), small (0.75x), medium (1x), large (1.5x), huge (2x), gargantuan (3x)
  - [x] Add set-token-size message type to @shared
  - [x] Implement TokenService.setTokenSize with lock check
  - [x] Implement TokenService.setTokenSizeByDM for DM override
  - [x] Add validation middleware for set-token-size
  - [x] Update scene graph to include token size
  - [x] UI controls in PlayerCard settings to change size (3x2 button grid)
  - [x] UI controls in NpcCard settings for DM (3x2 button grid)
  - [x] Visual size scaling on tokens in TokensLayer
  - [x] Respect locked state (locked tokens require DM override)

- [x] **Comprehensive Testing (TDD)**
  - [x] 14 tests for token size service (tokenSize.test.ts)
  - [x] 7 tests for validation middleware
  - [x] 3 tests for message router
  - [x] 6 tests for TokenModel persistence
  - [x] 30 total new tests, all passing
  - [x] 99.02% coverage on TokenService

### Success Criteria Achieved
- ✅ All tests written first (TDD methodology)
- ✅ Tokens can be resized via UI settings menu
- ✅ Size changes visible in real-time on map
- ✅ Ownership validation enforced
- ✅ Lock state respected (DM override works)
- ✅ Size persists in scene graph and state
- ✅ Test coverage >80% (80.99% overall, 99.02% on TokenService)

### Deferred to Phase 12

- [ ] **Selection State Management** - See Phase 12
- [ ] **Multi-Select** - See Phase 12

## ✅ Phase 13: Tool & Alignment Polish (COMPLETE - Oct 2025)

**Status**: UX polish for tabletop tooling shipped; tool toggles, measurement flow, and map alignment now feel cohesive.

- [x] Unified tool state management so header buttons instantly reflect the active mode and deselect prior tools.
- [x] Measurement tool now auto-closes after a distance is placed and exits with `Esc`, staying consistent with other tool workflows.
- [x] Delivered a Grid Alignment Wizard: DM captures two grid corners, previews scale/rotation deltas, and applies the transform directly from the DM menu.
- [x] Added alignment math helpers (`computeMapAlignmentTransform`) plus overlay guidance to capture points at high zoom.
- [x] Extended the transform gizmo with a center translation handle while restoring original draggable settings after interaction.

## ✅ Phase 12: Menu System Unification (COMPLETE - Oct 2025)

**Status**: All draggable windows now have position persistence. All menus use DraggableWindow component with localStorage.

### Completed Features

- [x] **Enhanced DraggableWindow Component**
  - [x] localStorage persistence with `storageKey` prop
  - [x] Bounds checking to prevent off-screen dragging
  - [x] Window resize event handling

- [x] **All Menus Refactored**
  - [x] PlayerSettingsMenu uses DraggableWindow + Portal (`storageKey="player-settings-menu"`)
  - [x] NpcSettingsMenu uses DraggableWindow + Portal (`storageKey="npc-settings-menu"`)
  - [x] DMMenu uses DraggableWindow (`storageKey="dm-menu"`)
  - [x] DrawingToolbar uses DraggableWindow (`storageKey="drawing-toolbar"`)
  - [x] DiceRoller uses DraggableWindow (`storageKey="dice-roller"`)
  - [x] RollLog uses DraggableWindow (`storageKey="roll-log"`)

### Success Criteria Achieved
- ✅ All menus use DraggableWindow component
- ✅ Menu positions persist across page refreshes
- ✅ PlayerSettingsMenu no longer causes EntitiesPanel scrolling
- ✅ DMMenu is movable and remembers position
- ✅ Consistent JRPG styling across all windows
- ✅ No z-index conflicts when multiple menus open
- ✅ Sensible default positions for first-time users
