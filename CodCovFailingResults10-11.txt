CodCov failure summary (Oct 11)
--------------------------------

- Latest `dev` workflow failed at the Codecov step because aggregate coverage dropped beneath Codecov's default threshold.
- Coverage files uploaded by CI:
    • `packages/shared/coverage/coverage-final.json`  → 99% statements  
    • `apps/server/coverage/coverage-final.json`      → ~80% statements  
    • `apps/client/coverage/coverage-final.json`      → ~13% statements (dominates total LOC)
- Because the client bundle contains the majority of executable lines, the overall weighted coverage reported by Codecov is currently ~28%.

Next steps
----------
1. Grow client-side coverage (focus: DM menu alignment wizard, `mapAlignment.ts`, `TransformGizmo`, pointer/measure hooks).
2. Keep running `pnpm test:coverage` locally to ensure all three coverage reports are emitted and healthy.
3. Once coverage improves (or if we intentionally tweak Codecov settings), push again—README badges will update on the next green run.
