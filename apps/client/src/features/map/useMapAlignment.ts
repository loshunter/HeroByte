 * Manages map alignment mode with grid calculations and coordinate transformations.
 * Provides a two-point alignment system that computes optimal map positioning,
 * scaling, and rotation to align with the game grid.

 * Extraction date: 2025-10-20
 *
 * This hook handles:
 * - Alignment point capture and management (max 2 points)
 * - Automatic grid alignment transform computation
 * - Map transformation application with position, scale, and rotation
 * - Error detection and tolerance checking
 * - Tool mode lifecycle management

/**
 * Hook for managing map alignment with grid calculations and coordinate transformations.
 *
 * The alignment process works as follows:
 * 1. User activates alignment mode via handleAlignmentStart
 * 2. User captures 2 points by clicking on the map (each point has world and local coords)
 * 3. Hook automatically computes optimal transform (position, scale, rotation)
 * 4. User reviews the suggestion and applies it via handleAlignmentApply
 *
 * The transform computation uses least-squares fitting to find the best alignment
 * that minimizes the error between the captured points and their target grid positions.
 *
 * @param options - Hook dependencies including tool state, grid config, and actions
 * @returns Alignment state and handler functions
 *
 * @example
 * ```tsx
 * const alignment = useMapAlignment({
 *   activeTool,
 *   setActiveTool,
 *   gridSize: 70,
 *   mapSceneObject: snapshot?.sceneObjects?.find(obj => obj.type === "map"),
 *   transformSceneObject
 * });
 *
 * // Start alignment
 * alignment.handleAlignmentStart();
 *
 * // Capture points (called by MapBoard on click)
 * alignment.handleAlignmentPointCapture({
 *   world: { x: 100, y: 100 },
 *   local: { x: 0, y: 0 }
 * });
 *
 * // Apply transformation
 * if (alignment.alignmentSuggestion) {
 *   alignment.handleAlignmentApply();
 * }
 * ```
