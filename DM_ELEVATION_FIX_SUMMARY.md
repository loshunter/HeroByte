# DM Elevation Bug Fix - Summary

**Date**: 2025-10-19
**Issue**: Users unable to elevate to DM across all branches
**Status**: ✅ FIXED

## Problem Statement

Users were unable to make themselves DM because:

1. No DM password had been set (no `herobyte-room-secret.json` file with DM credentials)
2. Server rejected elevation attempts with "No DM password configured"
3. Client had no UI to set the initial DM password
4. This created a catch-22: can't become DM without a password, can't set a password without UI

## Solution Overview

### Two-Part Fix

1. **Client-Side**: Added intelligent error handling and bootstrap flow
2. **Server-Side**: Added default DM password for development (`FunDM`)

## Changes Made

### 1. Client Updates (apps/client/src/ui/App.tsx)

**Added Bootstrap Flow:**

- Detects "No DM password configured" error
- Prompts user to set initial DM password
- Validates password (minimum 8 characters)
- Sends `set-dm-password` message to server
- Shows success/failure toasts

**Added Message Handlers:**

- `dm-password-updated` → Success toast
- `dm-password-update-failed` → Error toast

**Code Location**: `apps/client/src/ui/App.tsx:599-632`

### 2. Server Updates

**File: apps/server/src/config/auth.ts**

- Added `DEV_FALLBACK_DM_PASSWORD = "FunDM"`
- Added `getDMPassword()` function
- Logs warning when using development fallback

**File: apps/server/src/domains/auth/service.ts**

- Import `getDMPassword` from config
- Initialize `StoredSecret` with default DM password on first run
- DM password now persists in `herobyte-room-secret.json`

**Code Locations**:

- `apps/server/src/config/auth.ts:8, 37-51`
- `apps/server/src/domains/auth/service.ts:8, 169-194`

### 3. Documentation

**Created:**

- `docs/DEMO_SERVER_WORKFLOW.md` - Complete guide for managing demo server sessions

**Updated:**

- `README.md` - Added default DM password documentation
- `ROOM_AUTH_FLOW.md` - Updated with default passwords and bootstrap flow

## Default Credentials

| Type          | Default Value | Environment Variable   |
| ------------- | ------------- | ---------------------- |
| Room Password | `Fun1`        | `HEROBYTE_ROOM_SECRET` |
| DM Password   | `FunDM`       | `HEROBYTE_DM_PASSWORD` |

## User Flows

### First-Time DM Elevation (No Password Set)

1. User clicks "Make myself DM"
2. Enters any password (e.g., "test")
3. Server responds: "No DM password configured"
4. Client shows confirmation: "Would you like to set one now?"
5. User confirms → prompted for new password
6. User enters password (8+ chars)
7. Server creates DM password and grants DM status
8. Success toast: "DM password set successfully!"

### Standard DM Elevation (With Default Password)

1. User clicks "Make myself DM"
2. Enters `FunDM`
3. Instantly becomes DM
4. Success toast: "DM elevation successful!"

### Game Session Workflow

See `docs/DEMO_SERVER_WORKFLOW.md` for complete guide:

1. **Pre-Game**: Become DM, set private room password
2. **During Game**: Share password with players, manage session
3. **Post-Game**: Save session, reset to defaults (manual for now)

## Testing

**Manual Testing:**

1. Start fresh server (no `herobyte-room-secret.json`)
2. Connect as player with room password `Fun1`
3. Click settings → "Make myself DM"
4. Enter `FunDM`
5. ✅ Should become DM immediately

**With Custom Password:**

1. Delete `apps/server/herobyte-room-secret.json`
2. Restart server
3. Try to become DM with wrong password
4. Should be prompted to set new DM password
5. ✅ Should become DM after setting password

## Production Considerations

**Environment Variables:**

```bash
# Production .env
HEROBYTE_ROOM_SECRET="$(openssl rand -base64 32)"
HEROBYTE_DM_PASSWORD="$(openssl rand -base64 32)"
HEROBYTE_ALLOWED_ORIGINS="https://yourdomain.com"
```

**Security:**

- Defaults are for development only
- Use strong passwords in production
- Enable CORS restrictions
- Use HTTPS/WSS in production

## Future Enhancements

See `docs/DEMO_SERVER_WORKFLOW.md` for planned features:

- [ ] "Reset to Demo Mode" button (one-click cleanup)
- [ ] Session templates (save/load configurations)
- [ ] Guest mode (temporary access)
- [ ] Auto-cleanup after inactivity
- [ ] Password generation UI
- [ ] Invite links (time-limited URLs)

```

## Migration Notes

**Existing Deployments:**

- Server will auto-create DM password on first run
- No manual migration needed
- Existing room passwords are preserved
- DM password adds to existing `herobyte-room-secret.json`

**Breaking Changes:**

- None. Fully backward compatible.
