## Architecture

This is a monorepo built with **domain-driven design** and a strict separation between client, server, and shared contracts.

- **Client (`apps/client`)** – React + TypeScript + Konva
  - Feature-based folders with memoized map layers and context-aware hooks
  - WebSocket transport wrapper for real-time events and a WebRTC voice service
  - Local history managers for drawings, selections, and camera state
- **Server (`apps/server`)** – Node.js + ws + TypeScript
  - Domain modules (map, token, selection, dice, room, player) orchestrated via dependency injection
  - Middleware pipeline for authentication, validation, and rate limiting
  - Persistence layer writes snapshots to disk for crash-safe sessions
- **Shared (`packages/shared`)** – Canonical message schemas and DTOs consumed by both sides

### High-Level Flow

Contributors should familiarize themselves with the `@shared` schemas first—they define every WebSocket payload, ensuring the client and server stay in lockstep.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- pnpm 8+

### Recommended Global Setup

```bash
# Enable pnpm if you normally use npm/yarn
corepack enable pnpm
```

### Installation

```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install
```

### Running Locally

**Quick Start (Recommended):**

```bash
# From project root - automatically handles cleanup, build, and startup
./dev-start.sh
```

This script:

- Cleans up any stuck processes/ports
- Builds the backend
- Starts both servers in the correct order
- Shows you the URLs and PIDs

**Manual Start (Alternative):**

```bash
# Terminal 1: Start the backend
pnpm dev:server

# Terminal 2: Start the frontend
pnpm dev:client
```

**Port Issues?**

If you get "port already in use" errors:

```bash
./kill-ports.sh  # Cleans up stuck processes
```

See [PORT_MANAGEMENT.md](PORT_MANAGEMENT.md) for detailed troubleshooting.

**Access the Application:**

- Frontend: `http://localhost:5173`
- Backend: `http://localhost:8787`
- Default Room Password: `Fun1` (change it via DM Menu ▶ Session ▶ Room Security or by setting `HEROBYTE_ROOM_SECRET`)
- Default DM Password: `FunDM` (use this to elevate to Dungeon Master role, or set `HEROBYTE_DM_PASSWORD` to customize)

### Network Access

To use on your local network:

- Find your IP address (e.g. `192.168.x.x`)
- Access at: `http://YOUR_IP:5173`
- The server automatically listens on all interfaces

### Security Configuration

- Set `HEROBYTE_ROOM_SECRET` in `.env` to override the development fallback room password (`Fun1`).
- Set `HEROBYTE_DM_PASSWORD` in `.env` to override the development fallback DM password (`FunDM`).
- Restrict HTTP/WebSocket origins with `HEROBYTE_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` (comma-separated list). Defaults cover local development (`http://localhost:5173`, `http://127.0.0.1:5173`) and the hosted demo (`https://herobyte.pages.dev`). Example:

```bash
HEROBYTE_ROOM_SECRET="your-secure-room-password"
HEROBYTE_DM_PASSWORD="your-secure-dm-password"
HEROBYTE_ALLOWED_ORIGINS="https://yourdomain.com,https://staging.yourdomain.com"
```

### Common Project Scripts

| Command                               | Description                                              |
| ------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `pnpm dev`                            | Run client and server concurrently (uses `concurrently`) |
| `pnpm dev:server` / `pnpm dev:client` | Start a single target in watch mode                      |
| `pnpm build`                          | Build both server and client bundles                     |
| `pnpm test:shared`                    | Execute unit tests for shared domain models              |
| `pnpm test:e2e`                       | Run Playwright smoke tests (auto-starts dev servers)     |

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run the full monorepo suite (shared + server + client)
pnpm test

# Focus on a single package
pnpm test:shared
pnpm test:server
pnpm test:client

# Generate coverage reports for all packages
pnpm test:coverage
```

Tests rely on Vitest across packages, so the first run may take a moment while caches warm. The suite can be executed headlessly in CI, and it is safe to interrupt with `Ctrl+C` when running locally—partial results are discarded automatically.

### Troubleshooting

- **Dev server says port 5173 is busy** – Run `./kill-ports.sh` (or `./kill-client-port.bat` on Windows). If the port keeps reappearing, switch the client to use 5174 by exporting `VITE_PORT=5174` before running `pnpm dev:client`.
- **WebSocket refuses connections** – Confirm the backend is running on `http://localhost:8787`. When tunneling or using a non-default origin, set `VITE_WS_URL` so the client knows the correct WebSocket endpoint.
- **Voice chat fails in Chrome** – WebRTC requires secure origins; use `https://` (Cloudflare tunnel, `mkcert`, or run against the hosted demo). Self-signed certificates must be trusted locally.
- **Tests fail with missing state file** – Delete `apps/server/herobyte-state.json` if a previous run left a partial snapshot, then re-run `pnpm test`. The server suite stubs disk access and will regenerate a clean file.
- **"Room secret not set" warning** – Set `HEROBYTE_ROOM_SECRET` in `.env` to avoid falling back to the insecure development secret when running long-lived sessions.
- **Map images don't load (CORS errors)** – Some image hosts block cross-origin requests. Use CORS-friendly hosting like Discord CDN, Imgur, or Cloudinary. Upload your image to Discord, right-click → "Copy Link", and paste that URL as your map background.

## Contributing

We welcome pull requests—especially around the CRITICAL items called out in [TODO.md](TODO.md). Open issues use P0/P1/P2 labels so you can quickly gauge priority.

### Preferred PR Workflow

1. Fork and branch from `dev` (`feature/<short-name>`).
2. Sync dependencies (`pnpm install`) and run the app (`pnpm dev`) to verify your environment.
3. Make focused commits with clear messages; favor small, reviewable changes.
4. Add or update tests that cover the new behavior (`pnpm test`, or `pnpm test:<package>` when editing a single package).
5. Run `pnpm lint` to ensure the codebase stays warning-free.
6. Update affected docs (README/DEVELOPMENT/TESTING) when workflows or user-facing behavior change.
7. Open a PR against `dev` using the template, summarizing the change and linking relevant TODO items or issues.

Before requesting review, double-check the CI status locally. If you are unsure how to validate something, mention it in the PR description so maintainers know what still needs attention.

See [DEVELOPMENT.md](DEVELOPMENT.md) for day-to-day workflow norms and [TESTING_SETUP.md](TESTING_SETUP.md) for detailed testing expectations.
