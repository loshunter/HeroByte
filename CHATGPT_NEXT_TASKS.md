# ChatGPT Next Tasks

You've completed **Phase 1-3: Testing Infrastructure & CI/CD**. Excellent work! ðŸŽ‰

Here are your next options. **Choose ONE lane to focus on:**

---

## Option 1: Contributor Polish (RECOMMENDED NEXT)

**Goal**: Finish the CRITICAL contributor-readiness items to make the repo welcoming for newcomers.

### Tasks

1. **Create CONTRIBUTING.md**
   - Location: `/home/loshunter/HeroByte/CONTRIBUTING.md`
   - Contents:

     - Code Style Guide (ESLint, Prettier, TypeScript strict mode)
     - Testing Requirements (run `pnpm test`, add tests for new features)
     - PR Process (create PR, link issues, wait for CI, code review)
     - Commit Message Guidelines (concise, descriptive)
   - Reference: See DEVELOPMENT.md and TESTING_SETUP.md for context

2. **Create GitHub Issue Templates**

   **Bug Report** - `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md`:

   ```markdown
   ## Description
   Brief description of what this PR does.

   ## Related Issues
   Closes #[issue number]

   ## Changes Made
   - [ ] Added/Updated feature X
   - [ ] Fixed bug Y
   - [ ] Added tests for Z

   ## Testing
   - [ ] All tests pass (`pnpm test`)
   - [ ] Linting passes (`pnpm lint`)
   - [ ] Tested locally

   ## Screenshots (if applicable)
   Add screenshots or GIFs showing the changes.

   ## Checklist
   - [ ] Code follows project style guidelines
   - [ ] Tests added/updated for new functionality
   - [ ] Documentation updated (README, TODO, etc.)
   - [ ] No breaking changes (or documented if unavoidable)
   ```

4. **Update TODO.md**
   - Mark completed items in CRITICAL section:
     - [x] Issue Templates
     - [x] Pull request template
     - [x] Contributing guidelines

### Success Criteria
- âœ… CONTRIBUTING.md exists and is comprehensive
- âœ… 3 GitHub templates created (.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/*, .github/pull_request_template.md)
- âœ… TODO.md updated with completed items
- âœ… Ready for external contributors

---

## Option 2: Feature Roadmap (Phase 9 Work)

**Goal**: Implement Phase 9 features (Core State & Persistence).

### Tasks (Pick ONE to start)

#### 2A: Undo/Redo System for Drawings
- Add redo support (Ctrl+Y) to complement existing Ctrl+Z undo
- Location: `apps/client/src/hooks/useDrawingState.ts`
- Add `redoStack` state and `redo()` function
- Update keyboard handlers in `MapBoard.tsx`

#### 2B: Player State Persistence
- Create `playerPersistence.ts` utility in `apps/client/src/utils/`
- Implement `savePlayerState()` and `loadPlayerState()` functions using JSON download/upload
- Add Save/Load buttons to `PlayerCard.tsx`
- Test: Save player â†’ reload tab â†’ Load file â†’ state restored

#### 2C: Session Save/Load
- Create `sessionPersistence.ts` in `apps/client/src/utils/`
- Implement `saveSession()` and `loadSession()` for full RoomSnapshot
- Add Save/Load buttons to `Header.tsx`
- Test: Save session â†’ clear â†’ load â†’ full state restored

### Reference
- See TODO.md "Phase 9: Core State & Persistence" for full roadmap
- Follow SOLID principles (SRP, DIP, OCP)
- Add tests for new utilities

---

## Option 3: Code Hygiene

**Goal**: Clean up linting warnings to maintain code quality.

### Tasks (In Order)

1. **Fix Browser Globals in Client** (59 errors)
   - Add missing globals to `eslint.config.js`:
     - `WebSocket`, `HTMLElement`, `HTMLDivElement`, `KeyboardEvent`, `ResizeObserver`, `prompt`
   - Location: `eslint.config.js` â†’ React configuration â†’ globals section

2. **Replace `any` with `unknown`** (20 warnings in server)
   - Files to fix:
     - `apps/server/src/container.ts` (2 warnings)
     - `apps/server/src/domains/room/service.ts` (2 warnings)
     - `apps/server/src/middleware/validation.ts` (2 warnings)
     - `apps/server/src/ws/**/*.ts` (multiple warnings)
   - Use type guards or assertions after replacing `any` with `unknown`

3. **Remove Unused Imports** (multiple files)
   - Run `npx eslint --fix` to auto-remove unused imports
   - Manually review and fix remaining cases

4. **Lower Linting Thresholds**
   - After fixes, reduce `--max-warnings` in:
     - `apps/server/package.json` (currently 50 â†’ target 0)
     - `apps/client/package.json` (currently 200 â†’ target 50 â†’ target 0)

### Success Criteria
- âœ… All lint errors fixed
- âœ… Warnings reduced to <10 total
- âœ… CI lint check passes without `|| true` fallback

## Recommendation

**Start with Option 1: Contributor Polish**

This is the quickest win and completes the CRITICAL contributor-readiness work. It should take 30-45 minutes and makes the repo immediately ready for external contributors.

After that, you can choose between:
- **Feature work** (Option 2) for new functionality
- **Code hygiene** (Option 3) for technical debt

---

## How to Proceed

1. Choose ONE option above
2. Work through the tasks in order
3. Commit changes incrementally (one task per commit)
4. Push to `dev` branch when complete
5. Report back with summary of completed work

Let me know which option you want to tackle!
